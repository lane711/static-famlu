          <p align="justify">Members may create and maintain their own "Family
            Web Site" containing content contributed by members of the Family
            Web Site. A Family Web Site may also be used to engage in online
            discussion.</p>

          <p align="justify">Family Web Sites are established and managed by a
            Site Administrator. If you are the Site Administrator of a Family
            Web Site, you are subject to the following additional terms of use
            in relation to your role as an Administrator:</p>

          <p align="justify">As a Family Web Site Administrator:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p align="justify">You are responsible for deciding whether a
                Family Web Site is restricted to certain Members (a "Private
                Family Web Site") or accessible to the public generally (a
                "Public Family Web Site"). The default setting for any new
                Family Web Site is "private", and that setting may only be
                changed by the Administrator.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p align="justify">The Site Administrator may change an
                individual's access to a Family Web Site at any time, including
                by denying continued access to the Family Web Site to any
                individual who previously had access to that Family Web Site. As
                it pertains to all Private Family Web Sites, the Site
                Administrator decides which Members will be invited to
                participate in that Private Family Web Site, and the Site
                Administrator can access and change the invited Member list in
                his or her sole discretion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p align="justify">A Site Administrator may, at any time, transfer

          <p align="justify">The Site Administrator of each Family Web Site is
            responsible for maintaining and monitoring all content posted to
            that Family Web Site. The Site Administrator shall be responsible
            for ensuring that all content that is posted to that Family Web Site
            is in compliance with these Terms and Conditions, including but not
            limited to removing content that is not in compliance with the Terms
