This holds true whether it is a silly photo taken during your family vacation, a moving moment at the family reunion or a treasured baby picture. Thus, a family photo always stirs the memory and evokes fond recollection of great times.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Save the Family Photos, Save the Memories</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They may be precious photos, but many people do not take good care of them. Actually, many family photos are merely stashed in drawers or in boxes kept in closets, and are seldom brought out for viewing. This is not surprising since family photos can accumulate quite easily, especially if someone in the family loves taking pictures. And if they accumulate in an area in a disorderly manner, family photos can clutter an area.&nbsp; Sadly, most people do not have time or energy and perhaps even patience to organize their family photos neatly in a family photo album or memory book. You know what normally happens then; the photos accumulate dust and the precious memories are forgotten.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the advancements in technology, you can now preserve those family photos and save the memories that go along with them with the least effort. You can store your family pictures in a family website. You can create your family website on the Internet by visiting any of the family website providers online. Get your own family website and obtain the fullest benefits from today’s technology. Once you have a family website running, you can upload all your family photos..</p>

<p>Keep those precious memories of your family alive. Put the family photos taken during significant events on your family website. Include family photos of the zoo trip when the kids were young, the family vacation to the Smoky Mountain, and all your family travel photos. With the click of your mouse, you can easily view these family photos and relive the fun you had. Don’t forget the picture of your first child when he was born.&nbsp; Display it prominently on your family website so you can look at it over and over again, thinking back just how small your little boy was when you first held him in your arms. Remember how you felt back then?</p>

<p>You simply cannot risk losing these precious memories. Bring them to mind with those family photos that are far too valuable to be piled up in the closet together with other old articles. Place family photos where you can view them anytime you feel like to and share them with the other members of the family too.</p>


<p>Share the Family Photos, Share the Memories</p>



<p>Share your memories with family members who were not there with you when some of the family photos were taken through the family website. Post your family photos on the family website and write captions for each photo. Describe the events taking place in the photos. Make the description even more personal by sharing your thoughts and feelings about the photos. Why are they special to you?</p>

<p>This is a simpler and more efficient way to share your memories than writing on the back of each picture or explaining everything in a letter with the photo enclosed. Besides, you can ruin a good photo when you write on the back, and the ink can bleed onto the other pictures when you stack the family photos up. When you send photos to family members, you need to print a copy for each, write the accompanying letter again to each one, address an envelope for each recipient and then affix the stamp on each envelope before mailing it. The whole thing is just too tedious, time consuming and expensive.</p>


<p>A family website allows you to share your precious memories with the other members of the family conveniently and economically. You upload only one photo and write a description just once and then all of your family members can view the photo anytime they want. And if you wish to set the sharing experience up a notch, you can add family video clips on the family website.</p>

<p>Now, nobody gets to miss anything and everybody can readily share the memories of each and every occasion -- graduations, weddings, anniversaries, birthdays or the birth of a new family member. Through your family website, you get to share each important moment in your life with the entire family. And while the other members share your special memories, you can visit the photos time and again to think back of those wonderful times.</p></div>      </p>
